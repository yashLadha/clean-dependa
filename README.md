## clean-dependa

Clean-Dependa is a hobby project to learn rust and create something that is
bothering me from such a long time. It looks for all the user-repositories and
clears up the dependabot PRs of high severity.

Behind the scenes it is using the awesome Github API to perform these tasks.

## Enhancements

* To create PRs of all levels from Github and not just critical severity.
* Management of different orgs and not just the user.
